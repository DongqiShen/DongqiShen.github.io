Well, I just want to keep it simple, and appreciate for whom contribute to build this website. The blog template is from [cotes2022](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). 

I'm an AI engineer.

Iâ€™m documenting my learning notes in this blog.

Feel free to point out my mistakes, thanks.
